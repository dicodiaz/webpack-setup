This is a simple yet powerful webpack boilerplate for later use as a starting point in other projects. It includes an HTML template, a JS file and a CSS that's imported by the JS file. To build it yourself, you may follow these [steps](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/blob/main/todo-list/exercises/exercise_set_up_project_with_webpack.md).
