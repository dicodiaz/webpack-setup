# Webpack setup

This is a simple yet powerful webpack boilerplate for later use as a starting point in other projects. It includes an HTML template, a JS file, and a CSS that's imported by the JS file. To build it yourself, you may follow these [steps](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/blob/main/todo-list/exercises/exercise_set_up_project_with_webpack.md).

## Getting Started

To get Webpack up and running in another project, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository into your machine (Or download the .zip file and extract).
2. Open the project's folder.
3. Copy and paste all files and folders except app_screenshot.png, MIT.md, and README.md into the other project's root folder.
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm start`

### Considerations

- Intended only for use as a starting point in other projects. Do not copy and paste these files into more mature projects as this will overwrite your package.json and package-lock.json files.
- This project also includes Bootstrap for styling and Jest for testing.
- Remember to run `npm run build` before pushing to GitHub so that your last changes apply to your GitHub Pages deployed website.
- You may also run `npm run deploy` so that your website URL doesn't require adding `/dist` at the end of it. Remember to deploy your GitHub Pages website from the gh_pages branch after you do this so it works.

### Setup

Follow the steps described before.
